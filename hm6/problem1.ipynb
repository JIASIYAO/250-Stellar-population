    "\"G-Dwarf problem\" means the lack of metal-poor G dwarfs in the observation compared to the prediction from the simple closed-box model. Closed-box model means a closed box containing interstellar gas without metal in the beginning evolvs without any outflow or inflow. The deficit of metal-poor stars is a universial phenomenon both in different regions of the galaxy and in different types of galaxy. This may be interpreted from: changes in IMF, inflow from outside, inhomogeneous star formation, instantaneous recycling approximation, or overlooking the thick disk population"
